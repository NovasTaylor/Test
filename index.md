# Overview
This project is a proof of concept investigating the use of Linked Data for validation and submission of non-clinical study data submitted to the FDA. The work is comprised of two initiatives:

1. Modeling and validating nonclinical ([https://www.cdisc.org/standards/foundational/send](SEND)) data
1. FDA Submission Criteria

When both study sponsors and regulatory agencies use common data models and rules across the entire data lifecycle, data quality is greatly improved and the
submission and approval process is more efficient.
