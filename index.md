# Overview 
This project is a proof of concept investigating the use of Linked Data for submission and validation of non-clinical study data 
submitted to the FDA. The work is comprised of two intiatives:

1. FDA Submission Criteria
1. Modeling and validating nonclinical (SEND) data

# Goals
By modeling data validation checks and submission rules using Linked Data, sponsors can create data of exceptionally high quality. The same data validation rules 
used for data collection can be re-used for review prior to submission. When the same rules are used by both sponsor and regulatory agency,
the risk of a rejected submission is lowered.
