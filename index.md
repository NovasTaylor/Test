# Overview 
This project is a proof of concept investigating submission and validation of non-clinical study data 
submitted to the FDA. The work is divided into two intiatives:
1) FDA Submission Criteria
2) Modeling and validating nonclinical (SEND) data

# Goals
By modeling both data and validation checks using Linked Data, sponsors can create data of exceptionally high quality. The same data validation rules 
used during data collection can be re-used for review prior to submission. When the same rules are used by both sponsor and regulatory agency,
acceptance of the data transfer is virtually guaranteed.
